# HexMaze-Solver

This project implements a hexagonal maze solver using C++ and Dijkstra's algorithm. The solver is capable of generating loop-free and accessible mazes, and efficiently finding the optimal path from the maze's start point to its destination.

## Features
- Hexmaze generation: The project includes a maze geenration algorithm.
- Dijkstra's algorithm: A popular single source shortest path graph traversal algorithm. It works by exploring neighboring nodes from a starting point and gradually moving towards the destination, updating the shortest distances as it progresses.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Using GCC compiler, make the file using the `make` command on the terminal.
- Run the program using `./maze` command on the terminal. 
- Test the program using `./testMaze` command on the terminal.
