# HexMaze-Solver

This project implements a hexagonal maze solver using C++ and Dijkstra's algorithm. The solver is capable of generating loop-free and accessible mazes, and efficiently finding the optimal path from the maze's start point to its destination.

## Features
- Hexmaze generation: The project includes a maze geenration algorithm.
- Depth first search: Algorithm that starts at a particular node in a graph and explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking, visiting all nodes in a particular branch before moving on to the next branch. It follows the principle of depth-first traversal, prioritizing the exploration of nodes at the deepest level of the graph before visiting nodes at shallower levels. 

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Using GCC compiler, make the file using the `make` command on the terminal.
- Run the program using `./maze` command on the terminal. 
- Test the program using `./testMaze` command on the terminal.
